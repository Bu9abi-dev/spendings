# Decisions

Choices made while running the app on my own, newest first, with the reason for each.

## 30 Oct 2026

- **Charts (v14, PR #7):** the trend maths lives in a pure `trends.js` so it's testable and stays out of other
  branches' way. Refunds aren't netted against days or places, matching "Spent". "Usual" isn't pro-rated for the
  current cycle (bills land on fixed days); the card says "so far" instead. Pick a day by press-and-slide so the
  whole cycle fits on an iPhone.
- **Small changes get one Opus reviewer instead of the full council** (v13 script batch). The reviewer found
  that Arabic digits in Apple Pay amounts parsed as 0, which was fixed before merge.
- **Release bumps after a thread's PR go straight to main** as a version + changelog commit, so I don't push to
  another thread's branch while it may still be working on it.

- **Council on the foundation PR, lighter format.** Five advisors ran; they agreed so closely that I wrote the
  synthesis myself instead of spending six more agents on peer review and a chairman. Full council (with
  peer review) stays the rule for wave-1 features. Transcript: council/council-transcript-2026-10-30-foundation.md.
- **Phone-only extras win over the sheet** when the updated script first answers. They were saved later than
  anything the old script could have stored. Tracked per key, not with one flag.
- **Same account for allowance and main: Safe to spend is capped at that account's free money.** Otherwise
  Safe to spend could exceed the money that exists. Abdullah uses two accounts, so this changes nothing for him.

- **Review step uses the council skill.** The `council:council` skill is installed, so major features
  go through it before merging. Smaller fixes get an Opus code-review subagent instead.
- **Feature branches don't bump the version or the changelog.** Several threads build features at the
  same time. If each bumped `VERSION` in `docs/sw.js` and edited CHANGELOG.md, every merge would conflict.
  The loop thread bumps once per merge.
- **New features save their data in an "Extras" tab, one JSON value per key.** Abdullah's rule is "add
  tabs or columns only, never overwrite". One generic tab means budgets, goals and the rest need only one
  Apps Script update instead of one each. If the sheet still runs the old script, the app keeps extras on
  the phone and sends them up after the update, so nothing waits on the redeploy.
- **Split Activity and Insights out of main.js** into their own files (plus `views.js` for shared bits),
  so parallel threads edit different files. No behaviour change.
- **Fixed two date-dependent tests**, not the app: the fake sheet's `getSheets()` returned a live array
  (real Apps Script returns a copy), and the dismiss test assumed today was before the 1st's Nafis payday.
  The dismiss test now pins the clock to 5 Oct 2026.
- **"Where your money is" rows use largest-remainder rounding**, so the whole numbers shown always add up
  to the total shown. Rows that round to 0 are hidden.
- **Allowance account = main account is handled, not blocked.** Settings allows it, so Safe to spend is
  now subtracted from Emergency money instead of counted twice.
